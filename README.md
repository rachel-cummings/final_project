# How to run the code:

1. Use renv::restore() to install all necessary packages.
2. If the files in the download folder don't appear for some reason, download the activity, respondent, and roster files for 2019-2022 from [here](https://www.bls.gov/tus/data.htm).
3. In main.r (in the programs folder), change the working directory to whatever the path is on your local computer in lines 6, 16, 20, 29, 44, 357. Yes this is a stupid way to do this. I couldn't make it work any other way. Sorry.
4. Run main.r
5. The figures will be in the figures folder.
